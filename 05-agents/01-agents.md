# Agents üïµÔ∏è

We have reached one of the most flexible concepts in the realm of LLMs: **Agents**. So what are agents? 

Agents are autonomous tools that LLMs can access to help respond to user queries. Essentially, they interact with their environment to complete tasks or achieve specific objectives.

An example of this might be a Wikipedia agent, that allows the model to search for key parts of a query; or an internet search agent that retrieves the top relevant searches. While these are basic examples, we can imagine more advanced scenarios: a chatbot that can request your credentials to acess your personal data, giving you highly personalized answers based on that information.

The next video provides a simple introduction of Agents, explaining how to apply AI agents with LLM systems and showing some important things about this LLMs-Agents interaction.

## LLM agents

The purpose of LLM agents is to enable a model to integrate external tools and data directly into its responses. This is a game-changer, because it enables AI systems to handle complex and versatile inmplementations.


## Examples:
