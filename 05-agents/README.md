# LLM agents 🕵️👮

At the core of AI systems lie **agents**, designed to autonomously interact with their environment and input data for making decisions. Based on the ReAct* technique, these agents enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to decide when to use external tools or data to enhance their responses. This allows LLMs to fetch additional context, making them more effective in complex tasks. Agents are set to become fundamental in building autonomous AI systems that can perform sophisticated operations.

> *ReAct technique: The ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) technique is a method used in AI agents to improve decision-making by combining logical reasoning with actions. Agents first "reason" through a problem based on the available information and context, then "act" by deciding to retrieve external data or tools to assist in generating more accurate responses
