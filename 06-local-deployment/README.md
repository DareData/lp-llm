## Local deployment üè†

In this section, we'll give a general overview of deploying LLMs locally. It's essential to mention that the complexity of local deployment can change widely depending on your specific system and the available infrastructure.

Local deployment allows you to run models directly on personal hardware, rather than relying on external cloud-based servers. It provides benefits such as improved data privacy, reduced latency, and better control over model updates. We'll discuss the main pros and cons of local deployment and introduce some useful tools to help you get started.
