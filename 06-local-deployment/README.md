## Local deployment üè†

This section has to be taken with a grain of salt since we will only discuss a general overview regarding deploying LLMs locally. This is because this can become arbitrarily hard depending on the specific system and infrastructure that you have available. 

However, we will discuss the main pros and cons and present to you some interesting tools to start exploring the possibility of having these models on your personal hardware. Ready or not, head [here](01-local-deployment.md) and good luck!
