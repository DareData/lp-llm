# Ingestion and Indexation 🍽️


Data ingestion and indexation are one of the most important points of building LLM applications, specially for RAG systems, they are the key points for building successful scalable solutions. There are a _plethora_ of different approaches and in here we will explore some of them. 

> Note: even though this is is a very important issue, in a lot of use-cases, the simplest of approaches ends up being more than enough and that is why some of these tools we present are kind of basic.

In this module, we will learn about:

1. [LlamaIndex](01-LlamaIndex.md): one of the main tools regarding pre and post processing text. It has a lot of integrations with different formats and has some interesting approaches to enhance typical ingestions.
2. [LangChain](02-LangChain-ingestion.md): it offers a very basic ingestion system, suitable for most projects but very basic in nature.
3. [Vector Databases](03-VectorStores.md): these are the most sophisticated systems in all the module, they use advanced mathematical methods to efficiently deal with large amounts of data.
