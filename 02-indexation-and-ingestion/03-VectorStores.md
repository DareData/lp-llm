# Vector Databases  üóÉÔ∏è‚û°Ô∏è

A vector database is a specialized type of database designed for handling vector data. These databases are optimized for operations like vector similarity search, which is essential for applications like recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing.

They are ideal for applications requiring high efficiency in similarity search, like finding the most similar images, documents, or audio files. This is because they are highly efficient for similarity and nearest-neighbor searches in high-dimensional spaces. They use specialized indexing and search algorithms.

There are a couple of options available in the market. We recommend you to read [this article](https://www.sicara.fr/blog-technique/how-to-choose-your-vector-database-in-2023) to get an idea of some of the providers, while the video version of this article is the following one:

Finally, we present to you an **optional** resource on Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW), one of the most commonly used techniques for doing similarity searches.
