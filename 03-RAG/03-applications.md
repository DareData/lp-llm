# Applications

As we said before, by integrating RAG, developers can significantly improve the quality of AI-driven systems and adapt them for specialized use cases. While chatbots are among the most common of this applications, the potential of RAG extends far beyond it. 
The limit is creativity and architecture. 
You can imagine a wide range of implementations based on this technique. In this section will show a few of examples of the various applications and potential areas where RAG can be implemented to provide different solutions.


## Introduction to Applications and Potential Use Cases

RAG offers a flexible framework that can be applied in various industries and use cases. Due to the features and capabilities we already mentioned, RAG becomes essential in scenarios where up-to-date information, real-time data retrieval, or specialized knowledge is required.

Applications of RAG can be found in:

- **Chatbots**: Generating dynamic responses that reference the latest information.
- **Copilots**: Enhancing productivity by offering contextual suggestions.
- **Information retrieval and summarization**: Creating concise summaries based on long documents.
- **Industry-specific AI tools**: helping in medicine, law, finance, education... where accuracy is crucial.

Letâ€™s explore this specific examples.

## 1. **Chatbots and Copilots** ðŸ¤–ðŸ’¬

Even though we have already mentioned this on the video above, we can create a sequence of chains (if in LangChain) or processes to create a more efficient and safe chatbot. The architecture of the chatbot might include:

- **Summarization**: what has been the conversation about so far until now.
- **Intent recognition**: is the question asked by the user legit? Is the user trolling or insulting the chat? Is the user trying to force the chatbot into providing him with sensitive answer / information?.
- **Topic recognition**: what is the topic of the user's question? (this will help with information retrieval).
- **Language recognition**: what is the language of the question?.
- **Safe replies**: are the chunks of information relevant to answer the question?.
- **Source retrieval**: if using a knowledge base as a reference, what are the sources used to build the answer?.

Chatbots powered by RAG can: access to real-time information, reduce hallucinations and adapt the responses to new content.

### Copilots

Copilots are a secondary form of chatbots. The idea is not directly talking to the user, but assisting during the interaction. They are designed to help professionals by suggesting ideas, drafting documents, helping to make decissions, ... .

A few examples of what RAG-based copilots can do:

- **Assist software developers** by pulling examples or snippets from an updated codebase.
- **Support legal professionals** by retrieving relevant case law or statutes.
- **Help marketers** by generating insights based on recent campaign data, enabling decisions driven by current trends.


## 2. **Summarization and Information Extraction**

Another huge set of possible application/s entails summarization and information extraction. Basically, it means using an LLM to either summarize or extract relevant information from huge texts. Let us provide a couple interesting implementations:

- **Call summarization**: you can transcript a call with a speech-to-text tool and then ask an LLM to provide a summary of the interaction.
- **Call information extraction**: likewise, you could ask the LLM to fill out a form summarizing the interaction: caller's name, identifying number, address, issue, comments, etc.
- **Document information extraction**: you could ask the model to extract for you specific entities from a document. For example, you could envision a system in which freelancers or companies uploads all the relevant financial documents for the year and the system automatically generate the corresponding yearly fiscal declaration or quarterly VAT declarations. Or a system that summarizes complex and lenghty medical reports to understand and extract the important information inside of it.
- **Automatic reports via audio**: imagine a use-case where suppliers or other type of workers need to fill in daily reports or forms on different transactions. Having the possibility of simply describing the details to a cell phone immediately after the event increases accuracy and performance. 


## 3. **Advanced Use Cases - Industry specific AI tools**

In industry-specific AI tools, RAG can be a game-changer, particularly in fields like medicine, law, finance, and education, where precision is critical. By tapping into up-to-date, reliable, and specialized knowledge bases, RAG can enhance the accuracy of AI systems in these areas.

RAG also plays a key role in document retrieval systems and personalized search engines, improving how users interact with large and complex datasets. Hereâ€™s what RAG can do to make these processes more efficient:

- **Tailor results** to specific user needs, dynamically retrieving personalized information.
- **Integrate with CRM systems** to pull detailed insights on customers during a sales interaction.
- **Facilitate academic research** by enabling researchers to retrieve relevant papers or citations from large amounts of data.

In these advanced use cases, RAG can retrieve domain-specific content (e.g., medical research papers, legal documents, financial reports) and also tailor results to individual user needs. It can be retrieving legal documents for a lawyer or providing personalized financial advice - but is clear that the ability to deliver real-time, specialized, and personalized data makes RAG very useful in these type of industries.


## 4. **Final Thoughts**

All the applications mentioned in this document can be enhanced by additional capabilities. Some solutions may trigger different internal processes, such as a customer asking to change his address, or a chatbot asking relevant information to fill out a form during a call or a chat.

RAG is a versatile approach that can be implemented across many domains and with different features associated. As said, possibilities depend only on imagination and building good software architecture. With this ability to extend and customize RAG systems, the future of this technique holds even more potential, as developers continue to push its boundaries with new and innovative use cases.
